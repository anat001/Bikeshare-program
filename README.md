# Bikeshare-program
The goal of this program is to sort through a large file that stores the serial number and date of purchase of all the bikes 
that a bikeshare company has. The user has the option to enter in a serial number that corresponds to a certain bike and find out
exactly when the bike was purchased. The user also has the option to print a report of the serial numbers of all the bikes that 
are exactly 5 years or older.
